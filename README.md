# Interview task
This is my very own solution for an interview task. The goal of this task is 
to create a working, extendable implementation of a simple form generator without using any form-specific libraries.

# Concept
The goal is to create a form from scratch, without using any third-part library like 
Bootstrap or material-design. The form should consist of 5 fields:
  * Name - required, string
  * Nickname - required, string
  * E-mail - required, string - valid email 
  * Field - required, default empty
  * Position - required, options depenent on Field value, default empty

# Scaffolding

Setup for this project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project.
